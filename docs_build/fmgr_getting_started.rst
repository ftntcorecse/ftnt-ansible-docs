Getting Started - DEPRECATED
#######################################

These Ansible "base code" modules have been superseded by the new Ansible Galaxy Collections for FortiOS and FortiManager, and are no
longer included in Ansible as of version 2.10.

Redhat has removed all vendor/partner modules from the Ansible Base Code, and moved everyone to Ansible Galaxy Collections.

Active maintenance and development for these "base code" modules has ended, and the new collections are to be used going forward, which is the new active project from Fortinet Engineering.

Introduction
============

Beginning in Q1 of 2019 all up-to-date FortiManager modules now utilize a connection-plugin.
Existing installations must convert going forward.

- This requires modification to existing playbooks and inventory files that used the previous "connection: local" versions of FortiManager Plugins.

  - Follow the upgrade path defined below to utilize the new plugin.

- All updated modules, module_utils, and plugin will be included in Ansible 2.8 when it is released.

  - Ansible 2.8 is expected 05-16-2019: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/ROADMAP_2_8.html
  - Until then, ansible components must be manually installed. Instructions are below.


Pre-Requisites
==============

- Minimum Ansible Version: 2.7+
- Minimum Python Version: 2.7+

  - Works with Python 3.x

- Minimum FortiManager Version: 6.0+
- FortiManager account with rpc read/write enabled via CLI
- A licensed FortiManager appliance or VM.


Fresh Installation
=============================

Step 1 - Auto Installation Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After about 05-16-2019, the most recent versions of FortiManager ansible components
will be available from a simple software package manager update or install of Ansible.

- Ansible Installation Guide: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

After install, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   ansible --version

If the version is below 2.8, proceed to step 2.

If the version is 2.8+, skip to step 3.


Step 2 (Optional) - Manual Installation Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary
"""""""

- Until about 05-16-2019, the most recent versions of FortiManager ansible components
  must be manually installed to an existing Ansible 2.7+ installation.

- Fortinet may make updates to Ansible components in-between Ansible release dates, and they can be installed
  in-between Ansible release schedules, manually.

- These most-recent versions are located on the official FNDN github repo here:
  https://github.com/ftntcorecse/fndn_ansible

Steps
"""""

- First, make sure Ansible is already installed, and shows version 2.7+.

- The plugin and module_utils need to be copied to their correct locations. On Ubuntu running Python 2.7, the paths are:

.. code-block:: shell

   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/plugins/httpapi/
   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/module_utils/network/fortimanager/

- If you're unsure where to find this path on your own system, run this command:

.. code-block:: shell

    find /usr -name "ansible"

- ... and the path under a python dist-packages should present itself.

- The modules can be copied to any directory such as /usr/ansible_modules,
  as long as the library = <folder_path> line in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is edited to include that path.

- For other custom module path methods, see this guide:
  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_locally.html#adding-a-module-locally

Step 3 - Inventory File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following variables must be added to the hosts file entries that correspond to the FortiManager hosts:

- ansible_host=<ip/host>

  - Which FortiManager to connect to.
- ansible_network_os=fortimanager

  - Tells Ansible which httpapi plugin to search for

- ansible_user=<fmgr_username>
- ansible_password=<fmgr_password>
- ansible_become=no
- ansible_become_method=disable
- ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=true
- ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=false

  - Switch to True if using in production!
- ansible_httpapi_timeout=300

  - Sometimes it takes a while for FortiManager to process large requests or scripts. A large timeout is preferred.
  - In seconds.

These parameters can be added on the same line, or nested as shown in the code block below:


.. code-block:: shell

    [FortiManager]
    10.7.220.35 ansible_host=10.7.220.35

    [FortiManagerHA]
    10.7.220.36 ansible_host=10.7.220.36

    [fmgr_api:children]
    FortiManager
    FortiManagerHA

    [fmgr_api:vars]
    ansible_network_os=fortimanager
    ansible_user=ansible
    ansible_password=fortinet
    ansible_become=no
    ansible_become_method=disable
    ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=true
    ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=false
    ansible_httpapi_timeout=300


Step 4 - Playbook Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ansible should be ready to test now. Copy the following code block into a file named "test_fmgr.yml":

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: FMGR CONNECTION GET SYS STATUS
      hosts: FortiManager
      connection: httpapi
      gather_facts: False

      tasks:
      - name: TEST FMGR CONNECTION GET SYS STATUS
        fmgr_query:
          adom: "root"
          object: "custom"
          custom_endpoint: "/sys/status"

... and then run it with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible-playbook test_fmgr.yml -vvvv

If successful, it should report OK with Green Text and show various information about the target FortiManager.

If not successful, double check the hosts file, username/password combo, and that RPC read/write has been enabled for the FortiManager user.
The -vvvv verbose mode should indicate where the issue lies.



Upgrade to Connection Plugin
=============================
Because all new modules are converted to use the connection plugin,
the old method of using pyFMG and connection:local in playbooks is deprecated.

All playbooks must be converted to use the new plugin, and a few additions to the inventory file are required.


Step 1 - Inventory File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following variables must be added to the hosts file entries that correspond to the FortiManager hosts:

- ansible_host=<ip/host>

  - Which FortiManager to connect to.
- ansible_network_os=fortimanager

  - Tells Ansible which httpapi plugin to search for

- ansible_user=<fmgr_username>
- ansible_password=<fmgr_password>
- ansible_become=no
- ansible_become_method=disable
- ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=true
- ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=false

  - Switch to True if using in production!
- ansible_httpapi_timeout=300

  - Sometimes it takes a while for FortiManager to process large requests or scripts. A large timeout is preferred.
  - In seconds.

These parameters can be added on the same line, or nested as shown in the code block below:


.. code-block:: shell

    [FortiManager]
    10.7.220.35 ansible_host=10.7.220.35

    [FortiManagerHA]
    10.7.220.36 ansible_host=10.7.220.36

    [fmgr_api:children]
    FortiManager
    FortiManagerHA

    [fmgr_api:vars]
    ansible_network_os=fortimanager
    ansible_user=ansible
    ansible_password=fortinet
    ansible_become=no
    ansible_become_method=disable
    ansible_httpapi_use_ssl=true
    ansible_httpapi_validate_certs=false
    ansible_httpapi_timeout=300

Because the host, username, and password have all been added to
the connection/host level they must be removed from playbooks.

Step 2 - Playbook Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previous playbooks might look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: CONFIG FGT HOSTNAME AND INTERFACE
      hosts: FortiManager
      connection: local
      gather_facts: False

      tasks:

      - name: CHANGE HOSTNAME
        fmgr_device_config:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "{{ username }}"
          password: "{{ password }}"
          device_hostname: "ansible-fgt01"
          device_unique_name: "FGT1"
          adom: "ansible"

- The host, username, and password lines from each task need to be deleted.
- The heading attribute "connection: local" must be changed to "connection: httpapi"

Converted version of the above playbook:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: CONFIG FGT HOSTNAME AND INTERFACE
      hosts: FortiManager
      connection: httpapi
      gather_facts: False

      tasks:

      - name: CHANGE HOSTNAME
        fmgr_device_config:
          device_hostname: "ansible-fgt01"
          device_unique_name: "FGT1"
          adom: "ansible"

Step 3a - Auto Installation Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After about 05-16-2019, the most recent versions of FortiManager ansible components
will be available from a simple software package manager update or install of Ansible.

- Ansible Installation Guide: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html


Step 2 (Optional) - Manual Installation Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary
"""""""

- Until about 05-16-2019, the most recent versions of FortiManager ansible components
  must be manually installed to an existing Ansible 2.7+ installation.

- Fortinet may make updates to Ansible components in-between Ansible release dates, and they can be installed
  in-between Ansible release schedules, manually.

- These most-recent versions are located on the official FNDN github repo here:
  https://github.com/ftntcorecse/fndn_ansible

Steps
"""""

- First, make sure Ansible is already installed, and shows version 2.7+.

- The plugin and module_utils need to be copied to their correct locations. On Ubuntu running Python 2.7, the paths are:

.. code-block:: shell

  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/plugins/httpapi/
  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible/module_utils/network/fortimanager/

- If you're unsure where to find this path on your own system, run this command:

.. code-block:: shell

    find /usr -name "ansible"

    - ... and the path under a python dist-packages should present itself.

- The modules can be copied to any directory such as /usr/ansible_modules,
  as long as the library = <folder_path> line in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is edited to include that path.

- For other custom module path methods, see this guide:
  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_locally.html#adding-a-module-locally

Step 4 - Playbook Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After modifying the hosts inventory file, and either manually or automatically installing the latest FortiManager Ansible components,
the converted playbooks from Step 2 should now run.

For a sample status check, copy the following code block into a file named "test_fmgr.yml":

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: FMGR CONNECTION GET SYS STATUS
      hosts: FortiManager
      connection: httpapi
      gather_facts: False

      tasks:
      - name: TEST FMGR CONNECTION GET SYS STATUS
        fmgr_query:
          adom: "root"
          object: "custom"
          custom_endpoint: "/sys/status"

... and then run it with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   ansible-playbook test_fmgr.yml -vvvv

If successful, it should report OK with Green Text and show various information about the target FortiManager.

If not successful, double check the hosts file, username/password combo, and that RPC read/write has been enabled for the FortiManager user.
The -vvvv verbose mode should indicate where the issue lies.


Using Ansible Vault to Hide Logins
==================================
There are many ways to implement Ansible Vault. Feel free to use any method desired.
If no previous experience with Ansible Vault exists, we recommend starting with this method:

- https://medium.com/@schogini/ansible-vault-variables-a-tiny-demonstration-to-handle-secrets-a36132971015

The procedure is simple:

- Use 'ansible-vault encrypt string' on ansible host to create a vault string.
- Replace vault string in HOSTS or Variables file, for the username/password or both.

.. code-block:: yaml

  fortimanager:
    ansible_user: "ansible"
    ansible_host: "10.7.220.35"
    ansible_password: !vault |
      $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
      61366437333436393062623438393663366138633265363930313763383964313130643134383839
      3630663661626365366334646661303338313866373032330a636165373833366166616465373830
      34356466653464313134313664613435356238666139623165623132306538336565376265356633
      6362396137306466630a666562393637353863626436376132643464366661323734363830383164
      6366

- Add a reference to the variable file/vault file from the playbook itself:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    - name: Create and Delete security profile in FMG
      hosts: FortiManager
      connection: httpapi
      gather_facts: False
      vars_files:
        - group_vars/vault.yml

- And then run playbooks with --ask-vault-pass, or setup a password file to provide it.

It is recommended to keep vault secret variables in their own files, so the un-encrypted variables could be read by peers.
